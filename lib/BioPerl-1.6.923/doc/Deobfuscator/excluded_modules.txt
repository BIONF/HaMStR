# Excluded Modules file for the BioPerl Deobfuscator
#
# Module to be excluded from indexing should be listed here as a path,
# each on its own line.
#
# Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# Module names are matched by a right-end-anchored regular expression
# (i.e. /Module.pm$/ ), so the shortest unique path is probably best.
# Example: Bio/Tools/pSW.pm
#
# $Id$
#
# The modules below are excluded because they require external dependencies
# to compile (e.g. bioperl-ext), and Class::Inspector can't load modules it
# can't compile.
